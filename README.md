Example Project for 2024 Tech Lead Bootcamp

Instructions:

##Phase 1 [YOU]
- Fork the H4I nextjs-app-template. Make it a private repo. Name it your-name-test
- Create new VS code window, go into /hack4impact directory on your computer, and git clone [link from GitHub] and open the project.
- Install packages: install node if you don‚Äôt have it, run npm i to get most up to date, npm install next react react-dom
- Create an issue on GitHub:
    settings->features->turn on issues ..
    Name it "Another Tech Lead", to be self-assigned by another TL.
    Follow issue format, and write an appropriate checklist (copy and paste my example issue or write your own!!!)
- Now, create a homepage on your OWN project in your branch your-name, committing and pushing your own homepage with your intro card.
- Push changes to GitHub, make & approve/merge your own PR from new branch (your-name) back to develop.

##Phase 2 [TEAMMATE]
- Clone another TLs new mock project (make sure no one else assigned themselves to the issue first!)
- Assign yourself on the correct issue.
- Create a branch for your work (issuenumber-yourname)
- In your own branch, create a separate page /[your-name] with ‚Äòget to know you‚Äô info about you, following instructions in issue.
- Once completed, commit, push changes, and make a Pull Request to merge your own created branch to develop. Make sure to follow best practices with PR.


##Phase 3 [YOUü§ùTEAMMATE]
- When you see an incoming PR from another TL on your own repository, review the PR. Switch to their branch and npm run dev for a local run.
- Comment 2 things you like + 1 area for improvement on their PR.
- Ensure they are merging into the correct branch. If so, merge into develop, closing the issue. 

Congrats! You‚Äôll get used to this with more complexity this winter and spring!
