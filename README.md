Mock project - TL Bootcamp 2024

Time estimation: 30 minutes.

## Update [11/5]-
This is most optimal if you do this with your Co-TL! Make sure to give access/invite your Co-TL to your repository (thank you for bringing this up James!)

## TLDR - 
Phase 1 [You]: Set up and create a homepage in your own GitHub fork. Write a GitHub issue.
Phase 2 [Teammate]: Clone and contribute to the homepage in your repo by creating a new branch and opening a PR.
Phase 3 [You ü§ù Teammate]: Review, resolve conflicts, and merge their PR.

Instructions:

## Phase 1 [YOU]
- Fork the H4I nextjs-app-template. Make it a private repo. Name it your-name-test
- Create new VS code window, go into /hack4impact directory on your computer, and git clone [link from GitHub] and open the project.
- Install packages if not installed: (npm i to get up to date node)
- Create an issue on GitHub:
    settings->features->turn on issues ..
    Name it "Another Tech Lead", to be self-assigned by another TL.
    Follow issue format, and write an appropriate checklist (copy and paste my example issue or write your own!!!)
- Now, create a homepage on your OWN project in your branch your-name, committing and pushing your own homepage with something cool! (feel free to do something quick and easy or have fun with it :) 
- Push changes to GitHub, make & approve/merge your own PR from new branch (your-name) back to develop.

## Phase 2 [TEAMMATE]
- Clone another TLs new mock project (make sure no one else assigned themselves to the issue first!)
- Assign yourself on the correct issue.
- In the terminal, Create a branch for your work (issuenumber-yourname). git checkout -b (branch name)
- In your own branch, contribute code to the homepage (that the TL in phase 1 is currently working on..)
- Once completed, commit, push changes, and make a Pull Request to merge your own created branch to develop. Make sure to follow best practices with PR.


## Phase 3 [YOUü§ùTEAMMATE]
- When you see an incoming PR from another TL on your own repository, review the PR. (Switch to their branch and npm run dev for a local run).
- Ensure they are merging into the correct branch. If so, try merging into develop. There may be a merge conflict!
- In the end, you will want to keep both your and the other TL's code. 

Congrats! You‚Äôll get used to this with more complexity this winter and spring!
